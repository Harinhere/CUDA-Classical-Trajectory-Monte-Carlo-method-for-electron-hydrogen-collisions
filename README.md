The red electron is orbiting around the proton. The black electron passes by. Due to their mutual Coulomb interaction, the red electron is freed. That means, the hydrogen atom has ionized!

We would like to calculate the cross section for this event given the initial energy of the black electron, and the energy level of the red electron (the state of the hydrogen atom).

The Classical Trajectory Monte-Carlo (CTMC) method is applied to compute the cross section.
